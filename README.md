# 272-Roulette-Simulator-Project

This repository contains some homework and classwork I did in my Java 2 class.
There is a folder named RouletteSimulator which contains the final project I submitted.

The program is an application that can be executed through the main function, via an IDE. The IDE I was working with at the time was Eclipse.
The main function is contained in RouletteFrameViewer.java
